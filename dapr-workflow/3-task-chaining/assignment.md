# Workflow pattern: Task Chaining

In this challenge, you'll explore a workflow application that demonstrates the task chaining pattern.

## 1. Task Chaining

The task chaining pattern is used when the order of execution of the activities in the workflow is important. Typically this means there is a dependency between the activities. For example: the output of one activity is used as input for the next activity.

The workflow in this challenge consists of three activities that are called in sequence.

- The workflow is started with an input of `"This"`.
- The first activity adds `" is"` to the input and returns `"This is"`.
- The second activity adds `" task"` to the output of the first activity and returns `"This is task"`.
- The third activity adds `" chaining"` to the output of the second activity and returns `"This is task chaining"`
- The output of the workflow is `"This is task chaining"`.

### 1.1. Choose a language tab

Use one of the language tabs to navigate to the task chaining workflow example. Each language tab contains a workflow application, and a Multi-App Run `dapr.yaml` file that is used to run the example.

### 1.2. Inspect the Workflow code

Use the language-specific instructions to learn more about the task chaining workflow.

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET workflow code</b></summary>

Open the `ChainingWorkflow.cs` file located in the `TaskChaining` folder. This file contains the workflow code.

The workflow has an `input` of type `string`. This input is used as the input for the first activity. Each activity output is used as the input for the next activity. The output of the last activity is returned as the workflow output.

</details>

### 1.3. Inspect the Activity code

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET activity code</b></summary>

The three activity definitions are located in the `TaskChaining/Activities` folder. All activities append a word to the input.

</details>

### 1.4. Inspect the workflow & activity registration

Use the language-specific instructions to learn more about workflow registration.

<details>
   <summary><b>.NET</b></summary>

Locate the `Program.cs` file in the `TaskChaining` folder. This file contains the code to register the workflow and activities using the `AddDaprWorkflow()` extension method.

This application also has a `start` HTTP POST endpoint that is used to start the workflow.

</details>

## 2. Run the workflow app

Use the language-specific instructions to start the workflow application.

<details>
   <summary><b>Run the .NET application</b></summary>

Use the **Dapr CLI** window to run the commands.

Navigate to the *csharp/task-chaining* folder:

```bash
cd csharp/task-chaining
```

Install the dependencies and build the project:

```bash
dotnet build TaskChaining
```

Run the application using the Dapr CLI:

```bash
dapr run -f .
```

</details>

Inspect the output of the **Dapr CLI** window. Wait until the application is running before continuing.

## 3. Start the workflow

Use the **curl** window to make a POST request to the `start` endpoint of the workflow application.

Use the language-specific instructions to start the chaining workflow.

<details>
   <summary><b>Start the .NET workflow</b></summary>

In the **curl** window, run the following command to start the workflow:

```curl
curl -i --request POST http://localhost:5255/start
```

Expected output:

```text
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Length: 0
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:04:53 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Location: 67b4526c1c3a49fca2c4801869869016
```

The **Dapr CLI** window should contain these application log statements:

```text
== APP - chaining == Activity1: Received input: This.
== APP - chaining == Activity2: Received input: This is.
== APP - chaining == Activity3: Received input: This is task.
```

</details>

## 4. Get the workflow status

Use the **curl** window to perform a GET request directly the Dapr workflow management API to retrieve the workflow status.

Use the language-specific instructions to get the workflow instance status.

<details>
   <summary><b>Get the .NET workflow status</b></summary>

Use the **curl** window to make a GET request to get the status of a workflow instance:

```curl
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:3555/v1.0/workflows/dapr/<INSTANCEID>
```

Where `<INSTANCEID>` is the workflow instance ID you received in the `Location` header in the previous step.

Expected output:

```json
{
   "instanceID":"67b4526c1c3a49fca2c4801869869016",
   "workflowName":"ChainingWorkflow",
   "createdAt":"2025-04-17T12:04:53.094038635Z",
   "lastUpdatedAt":"2025-04-17T12:04:53.380547765Z",
   "runtimeStatus":"COMPLETED",
   "properties": {
      "dapr.workflow.input":"\"This\"",
      "dapr.workflow.output":"\"This is task chaining\""
   }
}
```

</details>

## 5. Stop the workflow application

Use the **Dapr CLI** window to stop the workflow application by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

You've now seen how to use the task chaining pattern in a workflow application. Let's move on another pattern: *fan-out/fan-in*.
